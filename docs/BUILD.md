# Building & running RotS locally

RotS's **shipping** binary compiles **32-bit** (`-m32` in `src/Makefile`). That cannot
build or run natively on Apple Silicon / modern macOS (Apple removed 32-bit support in
2019), so the 32-bit binary is built and run **unchanged** inside a 32-bit Linux (i386)
container. On arm64 Macs, Docker runs the i386 image via QEMU emulation — slower than
native, but fine for development.

As of Phase 2b, **Docker is no longer required for Mac dev.** The `macos-arm64` CMake
preset now builds, boots, and passes tests (including the characterization goldens)
natively on Apple Silicon — see "Native macOS arm64 build" below, which is the primary
day-to-day flow. The i386 container remains the **32-bit legacy-format guard**: it's
still how the *shipping* 32-bit binary is built, and it stays load-bearing until the
live server's player/world data is confirmed fully migrated off the legacy binary
formats (planned Phase 5) — at that point the 32-bit preset itself gets retired. Until
then, keep using it whenever you need to reproduce the exact shipping ABI.

This keeps the original binary save-file format intact (no code changes), so a Docker
build matches how the live game behaves.

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker Desktop for Mac** (Apple Silicon build) — https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   Verify with `docker --version`. Make sure Docker Desktop is running before the commands below.
   Required only for the container flows below (the 32-bit legacy-format guard and the
   `rots64` container); the native macOS flow ("Native macOS arm64 build" below) needs none.
2. **World files** at `lib/world/` — required to **boot** (not to compile). These are *not*
   in this repo; `lib/world/` is git-ignored and the upstream `Noobinabox/RotS-WorldFiles`
   repo is no longer publicly available. You need to obtain the world data and place it so
   that files exist at `lib/world/wld*`, `lib/world/mob*`, `lib/world/obj*`,
   `lib/world/zon*`, `lib/world/shp*`, etc. (The game `chdir`s into `lib/` at startup —
   `src/comm.cpp` / `config.cpp:58 DFLT_DIR="lib"` — and reads the `world/...` prefixes from
   `src/db.h`.)

   **If you have an old server backup**, use the importer to populate `lib/` from it:

   ```bash
   scripts/import-world-data.sh --backup /path/to/old/rots   # world + active players
   scripts/import-world-data.sh --backup /path/to/old/rots --world-only
   ```

   It extracts the world from the backup's clean `lib/world-for-6001.tbz` snapshot
   (whose `world/scr/*.scr` filenames match `world/scr/index` — the loose `lib/world`
   dir in a backup may contain macOS-munged `*.scr.txt` files that would make
   `index_boot()` fail), and copies the `A-E … U-Z` player buckets (the only ones the
   game indexes) into `lib/players`, `lib/plrobjs`, and `lib/exploits`. CVS metadata
   and `.DS_Store` are stripped; the `players/ZZZ` graveyard is skipped unless you pass
   `--with-graveyard`. Run `scripts/import-world-data.sh --help` for all options. All of
   this data stays git-ignored.

## Commands

A helper script wraps the common flows (`scripts/rots-docker.sh`):

```bash
scripts/rots-docker.sh build      # build the i386 toolchain image (first time / Dockerfile changes)
scripts/rots-docker.sh compile    # make setup + make all  -> bin/ageland  (no world files needed)
scripts/rots-docker.sh boot       # compile then start the server on port 1024 (needs world files)
scripts/rots-docker.sh shell      # interactive shell inside the container
```

Or directly with compose:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm --service-ports rots bash
#   inside the container:
cd /rots/src && make setup && make all      # build
cd /rots && ./bin/ageland                   # run on port 1024 (see -p note below)
```

## Connecting

The server listens on **port 1024** (default `DFLT_PORT`). Published to the host by
compose, so from a second macOS terminal:

```bash
telnet localhost 1024
```

The first character you create is auto-promoted to a level-100 Implementor.

### The `-p` flag (important)

`make run` launches `./bin/ageland -p`. The `-p` flag means **"expect a proxy"** — the
game then reads a 4-byte client-IP header from each new connection before anything else
(`src/comm.cpp:1186`). That header is supplied by the Rust `proxy/` (WebSocket bridge).

For plain `telnet` development, run **without** `-p` (as the helper's `boot` does), so the
game falls back to `getpeername` for the client address. Only use `-p` if you also run the
proxy in front of the game.

## Notes

- Build artifacts (`bin/ageland`, `*.o`) land on the host via the bind mount, but the
  binary is a Linux i386 ELF — it only runs inside the container.
- "deprecated function" warnings during `make all` are expected and harmless.
- The Rust proxy (`proxy/`) is not needed for telnet play; it builds natively on macOS
  with `cargo build -p proxy` if you later want browser-client access.

## Native macOS arm64 build (Phase 2b, primary Mac dev flow)

No Docker needed. Requires CMake ≥ 3.23 and GoogleTest (`brew install googletest`).

```bash
cd src
cmake --preset macos-arm64
cmake --build --preset macos-arm64 -j4
ctest --preset macos-arm64                                  # unit tests + goldens
scripts/boot-golden.sh --native build/macos-arm64/ageland verify   # boot vs. Phase 0 golden
```

The built binary lands at `build/macos-arm64/ageland`. `boot-golden.sh --native` runs it
directly on the host (no container) against the repo's real `lib/` data — same
poll/normalize/compare as the container flow, so a diff here is a real native-vs-container
behavior difference, not noise. This preset is 64-bit (native ABI, JSON-only persistence
from Phase 2a) — it is not the shipping 32-bit binary; use the i386 container (above) when
you need that exact ABI.

## The `rots64` container (64-bit Linux sibling)

`docker-compose.yml` also defines `rots64` — a 64-bit (Trixie x64, `Dockerfile.x64`)
sibling of the `rots` i386 container, running the `linux-x64` CMake preset against the
SAME bind-mounted `lib/` data. It exists to verify cross-ABI compatibility of the JSON
persistence layer (Phase 2a) independent of the macOS toolchain, and maps host port
**1064** (not 1024) so it can run alongside `rots` without a port collision — in practice
only one is booted against live `lib/` data at a time.

```bash
docker compose build rots64
docker compose run --rm rots64 bash -lc 'cd /rots/src && cmake --preset linux-x64 && cmake --build --preset linux-x64 -j"$(nproc)"'
docker compose run --rm rots64 bash -lc 'cd /rots/src && ctest --preset linux-x64'
scripts/boot-golden.sh --service rots64 verify
```

## Build matrix (Phase 3)

The authoritative build is CMake. Presets live in `src/CMakePresets.json`
(CMake ≥ 3.23 to use presets; the i386 container's CMake 3.18 uses the root
`Makefile` flow instead).

| Preset / path | Platform | Status |
|---|---|---|
| container + root `Makefile` (`make configure/build/test`) | Linux i386 (`-m32`) | **green — the shipping ABI; CI-required** |
| `linux-x86-legacy` | Linux i386 via multilib | builds the game; tests stay in the container path |
| `linux-x64` (native or `rots64` container) | Linux x86-64 | **green — boots, passes tests, matches the Phase 0 goldens; CI-required** |
| `macos-arm64` (native) | macOS arm64 | **green — boots, passes tests, matches the Phase 0 goldens; CI-required** |
| `windows-msvc` | Windows x64 MSVC | **green — configure/build/full ctest (goldens included); CI-required as of Phase 3 Task 7** |

Per-platform (from `src/`): `cmake --preset <name>`, `cmake --build --preset <name>`,
`ctest --preset <name>`. `cmake --list-presets` shows what runs on this host.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `legacy-32bit`, `linux-x64`, `macos-arm64`, and
`windows-msvc` are all required jobs — no job in the matrix is allowed to fail anymore.

### Windows: build+test green, boot verification deferred

`windows-msvc` networking runs through a hand-rolled, platform-gated socket shim
(`src/rots_net.h`/`.cpp`) — no third-party networking library. An earlier vendoring of
Asio (Task 1) was implemented, reviewed, and then **reverted** per a 2026-07-09
no-third-party-libraries decision; `platdef.h`'s Windows scaffold (winsock2 includes,
`SocketType`) survived the revert and is what the shim builds on. GoogleTest is the one
exception — it is test-only tooling, never linked into the shipping game binary, and on
Windows CI it is provisioned via CMake `FetchContent` (source-built against the exact
MSVC/CRT, cached in `actions/cache` keyed on `src/CMakeLists.txt`) since the windows-2022
runner carries no system GTest package; Linux/macOS keep `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)`
against apt/brew packages.

What Windows CI verifies today: `cmake --preset windows-msvc`, build, and
`ctest --preset windows-msvc` — the full unit suite including the characterization
goldens (JSON goldens are platform-neutral; the combat golden's RNG is `mt19937`,
platform-independent by construction). What it does **not** verify: a live server boot
against real world data — the windows-2022 runner has no `lib/world/` and there is no
Windows workstation in this project to run one locally, so `scripts/boot-golden.sh` has
no Windows path. This is a deliberate, documented deviation from the general "boots and
passes tests" bar the other three platforms clear, not an oversight.

Enabling a Windows boot check in a future phase would need: (1) a Windows host (or a
Windows CI runner willing to accept a long-running background process) with `lib/world/`
staged onto it, and (2) either a `boot-golden.sh` Windows/PowerShell port or a
cross-platform rewrite of that script, since it currently shells out to POSIX tools
(`nc`/process-signaling) that don't exist on Windows as-is.
